            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Sathya is a struggling cartoonist living in a slum who believes in 'adjusting' to injustice rather than fighting it. When his family is relocated to a poorly constructed government apartment, his life takes a surreal turn after a near-death experience. He begins hearing a god-like voice that dictates his every move like a panel in a comic book. Guided by this voice, the cowardly Sathya is transformed into a reluctant savior of the people, eventually facing off against the ruthless Minister Jeyakodi.</p>
